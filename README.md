## Restaurant Food Ordering 

# Dependencies
- Java8 or higher
- MySQL DBMS
- MySQL JDBC Driver
- Made on Apache Netbeans IDE 11/12

# Description
- Project I carried a bit far, which was initially made for twelfth grade final evaluation. 
- A completely beginner project to consider, undoubtedly gave immense satisfaction of making something  different and this big within the 2nd year of my introduction to Programming.
- Extensive use of java awt library for UI. Netbeans made it a piece of cake honestly. Complete UI with source end in bosic JAVA based object oriented programming.

# Features
- Lands user on Home Page. Leads to Login/SignUP further to menu page. Top menu bar allows to select cuisines and show dishes present in selected cuisine. Definitely, it can be limitlessly extended. After selecting the cuisine, a list shows up with dishes along with resp. rates stored in a MySQL database.
- Selecting items as per choice, add them up to a table in Invoice Pane. Can make it set visible/invisible with top Menu Bar.
- Further proceeding after checking the invoice, shows choices for payment methods (Cash/E wallet something). P.S. - This part isnt linked with any thing external. After entering details and proceeding, it counts to some 15-20 sec and then sends a confirmed message. Within this time, it was supposed to redirect to a payment portal, which was completely out of my scope that time.

# P.S.
- Initially decided, I would carry it more forward and will make a complete system with all working functionalities. Later discovered, carrying it forward would require redesigning it completely. Finally, since then, its like sort of an abandoned incomplete project, but still putting it here, coz it be my first accomplishment.
- If you like to go through it once, I ll be glad. Bear me :). 
<br/>Thanks.
